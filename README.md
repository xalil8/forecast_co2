# Task

The objective of the task is to see how you approach and build a model for reconstructing a time series signal based on other sensors in a sensory system. Furthermore, 
your task is to reconstruct the CO and Ethylene sensor based on 16 other chemical sensors. All sensors have a sampling frequency of 100Hz. Moreover, you have to predict
CO and Ethylene at t0 given the history of other sensors until t0.

# Implementation

Your task is to fill the `run.ipynb` and add any necessary function in the correspondent python script inside the `helpers` submodule. 

# Evaluation

You will be evaluated on the following (ordered by priority):

-	Analysis and preprocessing of time series.
-	Logical split ratio of the data.
-	Code design of the functions/classes in the `helpers` submodule.
-	The chosen model and the result.
-	The evaluation method used.
You are free to use any ML model also, please use scikit learn preprocessing pipeline to pre/post processing the data.
